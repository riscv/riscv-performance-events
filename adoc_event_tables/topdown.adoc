|Name |Description
|TOPDOWN.SLOTS |TMA slots available for an unhalted hart. In case of SMT the counts are distributed cycles between all active harts in the same physical core.
|TOPDOWN.FRONTEND_BOUND.SLOTS |TMA slots unused due to the frontend did not supply enough operations
|TOPDOWN.BAD_SPECULATION.SLOTS |TMA slots wasted due to incorrect speculations. This include slots used to issue uops that do not eventually get retired and slots for which the issue-pipeline was blocked due to recovery from earlier incorrect speculation. For example; wasted slots due to miss-predicted branches should be accounted by this event. Incorrect data speculation followed by Memory Ordering Nukes is another example.
|TOPDOWN.BAD_SPECULATION.CONTROL_FLOW.SLOTS |TMA slots wasted due to incorrect control flow speculations.
|TOPDOWN.BAD_SPECULATION.MEM_ORDERING.SLOTS |TMA slots wasted due to memory ordering violations.
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.SLOTS |TMA slots unused due to the lack of backend resources
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.SLOTS |TMA slots unused due to the stalls caused by load and store instructions
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.CORE.SLOTS |TMA slots unused due to the non-memory stalls
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.CORE.SERIALIZING.SLOTS |Number of slots wasted due to serializing operations like fence or csr accesses
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.ADDR.SLOTS |TMA slots wasted while waiting for address generation and translation
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.ADDR.TLB.L1_MISS.SLOTS |TMA slots wasted while waiting for address translation which missed L1 TLB
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.ADDR.TLB.L2_MISS.SLOTS |TMA slots wasted while waiting for address translation which missed L2 TLB
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.DATA.SLOTS |TMA slots wasted while waiting for data
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.DATA.L1_MISS.SLOTS |TMA slots unused due to the stalls caused by memory instructions which missed L1 data cache
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.DATA.L2_MISS.SLOTS |TMA slots unused due to the stalls caused by memory instructions which missed L2 cache
|TOPDOWN.BACKEND_BOUND.MEMORY.DATA.L3_MISS.SLOTS |TMA slots unused due to the stalls caused by memory instructions which missed L3 cache
