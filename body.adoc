== Groups

All the events and metrics are split between several groups which are described in details sub-sections below.
In addition most of the groups are further split into 2 variants:

* RET - for non-speculative events counted at retirement. For example, INST.RET counts retired instructions.
* SPEC - for speculative events. For example, INST.SPEC counts instructions that are issued to the backend pipeline, regardless of whether they retire.

NOTE: _In general, RET events are more useful for performance analysis, since they are consistent with software's view of the instruction flow. But they can be significantly more expensive to implement, as they require event data to be staged along with the associated instruction to retirement. It is up to implementations to decide whether to support the RET, SPEC, or both variants of an event._

=== GEN

This group contains general events not specific to a particular part of CPU pipeline. 

include::adoc_event_tables/general.adoc[]

=== RETIRED

This group contains events measured at retirement which didn't fall into any specific group below.

include::adoc_event_tables/retired.adoc[]

=== SPEC

This group contains speculative events which didn't fall into any specific group below.

include::adoc_event_tables/spec.adoc[]

=== CTRL_FLOW (retirement)

Retirement control flow group which contains events and metrics for counting all control transfer instructions, or just those that were mispredicted, including breakdowns by transfer type.

include::adoc_event_tables/prediction_retired.adoc[]

include::adoc_event_tables/prediction_metrics.adoc[]

=== CTRL_FLOW (speculative)

Speculation prediction group. Unlike most of the groups below prediction events mostly naturally counted only at retirement time. So this group contains only a few events which make sense to count speculatively.

=== CACHE (retirement)

This group contains events and metrics for data and instruction caches (all levels) counted at retirement.

include::adoc_event_tables/cache_retired.adoc[]

include::adoc_event_tables/cache_retired_metrics.adoc[]

=== CACHE (speculative)

This group contains events and metrics for data and instruction caches (all levels) counted speculatively.

=== TLB (retirement)

This group contains events and metrics for data and instruction TLB caches (all levels) counted at retirement.

include::adoc_event_tables/tlb_retired.adoc[]

include::adoc_event_tables/tlb_retired_metrics.adoc[]

=== TLB (speculative)

This group contains events and metrics for data and instruction TLB caches (all levels) counted speculatively.

=== TOPDOWN

This group contains events and metrics related for Topdown Microarchitecture Analysis (TMA) methodology.

TMA allows even developers with minimal microarchitecture knowledge to understand, for a given workload, where bottlenecks reside.  It does so by accounting for the utilization of each pipeline "slot" in the microarchitecture.  When the hardware is utilized with optimal efficiency, each slot is occupied by an instruction or micro-operation (a.k.a., uop) that will go on to execute and retire.  When bottlenecks occur, due perhaps to a cache miss, branch misprediction, or any number of other microarchitectural conditions, some slots may be either unused or thrown away, which results in inefficiency and ultimately reduced performance.  TMA is able to identify these wasted slots, and the stalls, clears, misses, or other events which caused them.  This enables developers to make informed decisions when tuning their code.

TMA accomplishes this by defining a set of hierarchical states into which each slot falls, based on the boundary between the frontend (instruction fetch and decode) and the backend (instruction execution and retire) of the processor.  Each cycle, the frontend can issue some implementation-defined number _N_ instructions/uops to the backend, hence there are _N_ issue slots to be categorized per cycle.  At the top level, issue slots fall into one of states depicted in the figure below.

.Topdown Level 1

* Frontend Bound - The frontend did not issue a uop to the backend for execution.  Example causes include stalls that result from cache or TLB misses during instruction fetch.
* Backend Bound - The backend could not consume an uop from the frontend.  Example causes include backpressure that results from cache or TLB misses on data (load/store) accesses, or from oversubscribed execution units.
* Bad Speculation - The uop was dropped, as a result of a pipeline clear.  Example clears include branch/jump mispredictions, or memory ordering clears.  This category also includes pipeline clear recovery cycles, during which issue slots go unfilled.
* Retiring - The uop retired.  Ideally the majority of slots fall into this state.

Many of the top-level states listed above include further breakdown at the 2nd and 3rd levels of the TMA hierarchy.  See details in the figure below.

[NOTE]
====
_Some imprecision within the event hierarchy is allowed and even expected.  The standard L2 and L3 events are unlikely to sum precisely to the parent L1 or L2 events, respectively, as it is expected that there are additional sources of bottlenecks beyond those represented by the standard events.  The exception is the Backend Bound L2 events (Core Bound and Memory Bound), which ideally should sum to the Backend Bound event total._

_Implementations may opt to add custom L2 or L3 events, to identify additional bottlenecks specific to the microarchitecture._
